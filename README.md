<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project demonstrates the use of generative processes in sound art. Heavily inspired by sound artists such as Ryoji Ikeda and Carsten Nicolai, I've created an art installation that can be experienced in Unity game engine.

This project uses graphical generative processes such as Boids and Stochastic functions to control sound movement.
